# cppinput-lib

**cppinput-lib** is a high-level, cross-platform library for capturing operating system inputs.

the central part which is the capture of inputs and is completely header only, because it only needs the calls from the respective operating system.

## Input Modes

cppinput-lib works in two different ways: **Global Mode** and **Local Mode**.  

---

## Global Mode

In this mode, the library hooks directly into the operating system and captures input events system-wide.  
It does not matter which application is in focus â€” all keyboard and mouse activity is detected.  

**Key points:**
- Input is captured from the entire system.  
- Works even if your application is not the active window.  
- Useful for hotkeys, automation, or monitoring tools.  
- Risky for games or apps because it may also react to inputs made in other programs.  

---

## Local Mode

In this mode, the library attaches itself to a specific application window.  
Only the inputs that belong to that window are captured, and anything typed or clicked outside is ignored.  

**Key points:**
- Input is captured only from the chosen window.  
- Events from other applications are ignored.  
- Safer for games or GUI applications.  
- Requires a valid window handle from the system or a windowing library.

## Comparison

| Mode       | Scope of Capture            | Typical Use Case                 |
|------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Global** | Entire operating system     | Hotkeys, automation, monitoring  |
| **Local**  | Specific application window | Games, desktop applications      |

to work with handle system, you should check the `Handle::` namespace (comming soon).

the exposed classes of cpp input-lib are virtual classes (starting with 'I') that inherit from another class that has common denominators.
an example with the IMouse and IKeyboard classes:

the library never exposes concrete classes, only interfaces (abstract classes) and you can use, 
through the backend of your system, the method `GetBackend(...);`

``` cpp

#include <iostream>
#include "input/keyboard.hpp"

int main()
{
   auto* kb = Keyboard::GetBackend();
   while(kb->Run())
   {
       if(kb->IsPressed())
       {
          std::cout << "my key is pressed!" << std::endl;
       }
       kb->Stop();
   }
      return 0;     
}

```

Example (IMouse):

``` cpp

#include <iostream>
#include "input/mouse.hpp"

int main()
{
    auto* ms = Mouse::GetBackend();
    while(ms->Run())
    {
      if(ms->IsPressed())
      {
           std::cout << "my mouse is clicking!" << std::endl;
      }
}
   return 0;
}

```

this ensures that any input system that contains buttons can have uniqueness in its methods.

## Base::IButton

the `Base` namespace is responsible for exposing common denominators internally in the application.

the `IButton` interface exposes all the methods that any device containing a button should have. The signatures are as follows:

`virtual void Run = 0;`

responsible for initializing the internal structures and descriptors of the device.

`virtual bool IsPressed() = 0;`

checks the press activity of any button on the device and returns `true` if there was.

`virtual bool IsReleased() = 0;`

checks if the activity has stopped on the device, returning `true` if it has stopped.

`virtual void Stop = 0;`

responsible for closing descriptors and resetting internal structures of the implementation. (it only resets, it does not delete)

and any interface that implements IButton contains these methods.
